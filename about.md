Hello! I am Ankur Abhinav. I work as a software engineer in Machine Learning team of Mercari, Inc., Tokyo.

My basic interests are Software Engineering and Machine Learning. Apart from that, I am also interested in Finance, Trading, Investments and Economics.

My hobbies include book reading, weight training and watching movies. I have recently started blogging as a hobby.
